# Testing environment

Before reading this article we recommend getting familiar with the CKEditor 5 {@link framework/guides/contributing/development-environment development environment}.

## Introduction

The CKEditor 5 testing environment uses a popular setup with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) and [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul). We created some [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) which glue all these pieces and special requirements for CKEditor together.

Each CKEditor package has its own tests suite (see for example the [engine's tests](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/tree/master/tests)), however, the test runner is available in the [`ckeditor5`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5) package which is the central development environment. The actual code of the test runner is implemented in the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests) package and can be easily reused outside of `ckeditor5`.

## Running automated tests

In order to run the automated tests use the `npm test [-- <args>...]` command.

It accepts the following arguments (must be passed after the `--` option):

* `--watch` (alias `-w`) &ndash; Whether to watch the files and execute tests whenever any file changes.
* `--source-map` (alias `-s`) &ndash; Whether to generate the source maps.
* `--coverage` (alias `-c`) &ndash; Whether to generate code coverage.
* `--verbose` (alias `-v`) &ndash; Allows switching on webpack logs.
* `--files` &ndash; Specifies tests files to run. Accepts a package name or a glob. Read more about the [rules for converting the `--files` option to a glob pattern](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/tree/master/packages/ckeditor5-dev-tests#rules-for-converting---files-option-to-glob-pattern).
* `--browsers` &ndash; Browsers which will be used to run the tests. Defaults to `Chrome`.

### Examples

Run all tests with the code coverage check of the [`ckeditor5-core`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core) package:

```
npm test -- -c --files=core
```

Run and watch the [engine's `view` namespace tests](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/tree/master/tests/view) and all the tests in [`ckeditor5-typing`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing):

```
npm test -- -cw --files=engine/view,typing
```

Run the `bold*.js` tests in the [`ckeditor5-basic-styles`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles) package:

```
npm test -- -cw --files=basic-styles/bold*.js
```

## Running manual tests

In order to start the manual tests server use the `npm run test:manual` task.

The task accepts the `--source-map` (alias `-s`) option.

It starts a server available at http://localhost:8125.

### Creating a manual test

A manual test consists of 3 files:

* A `<name>.md` file with the test description.
* A `<name>.js` file with the JavaScript part of the test (e.g. the code initializing an editor).
* A `<name>.html` file with the HTML part of the test. It does not need to be an entire HTML page (with the doctype, etc.), it can be just these HTML elements which you want to define.

All 3 files are combined together and create a single manual test.

Example Markdown file:

```md
## Create a new link

1. Select a fragment of regular text.
2. Click the toolbar "Link" button.
3. Check if the balloon panel attached to the selection appeared.
4. Fill in the "Link URL" input in the panel.
5. Click the "Save" button.
6. Check if the selected text is converted into a link.
```

Example HTML file:

```html
<head>
    <style>
        /*
          Some additional styles which this test needs.
          And yes â€“ the test builder will merge this tag with head defined in a template.
        */
    </style>
</head>

<div id="editor">...</div>
```

Example JS file:

```js
/* globals console, window, document */

import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classic.js';
import Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials.js';
import Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph.js';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Essentials, Paragraph ]
	} )
	.then( editor => {
		window.editor = editor;
	} )
	.catch( err => {
		console.error( err.stack );
	} );
```

	Do not forget to add all dependencies of your manual test as `devDependencies` (in `package.json`).

## Test suite and CI

To ensure the highest quality, we maintain a complete test suite with a stable 100% of code coverage for each of the packages. As of December 2017, this means over 7000 tests and the number is growing. Since every package is tested separately, we implement lower-level tests for libraries and higher-level tests for end-user features.

Such an extensive test suite requires a proper continuous integration service. We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) as a build platform and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to be able to run tests on all browsers. These services ensure seamless and fast developer experience and allow us to focus on the job.

Besides automated tests, we also maintain a smaller set of manual tests. They help us to verify whether something unexpected happens that might have been missed by the automated tests.

When proposing a pull request make sure to add test(s) which verifies it. Every code change should be accompanied by a test which proves that it is needed. Such a strict approach to testing ensures that not only we have 100% of code coverage (which is quite easy to achieve and gives only an illusory safety) but also a high level of coverage for cases which we failed to notice initially (and might do that again in the future).
