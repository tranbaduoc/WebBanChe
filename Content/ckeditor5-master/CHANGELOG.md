## [1.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0-beta.4) (2018-04-19)

### Release notes

This is a minor release that mainly focuses on stabilizing the [two-step caret movement around links](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/whats-new.html#caret-movement-around-links).

A breaking change was introduced in the [document editor build](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/overview.html#document-editor) â€“ refer to its [changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.4) for more information.

Finally, two new plugins were introduced â€“ [`ParagraphButtonUI`](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_paragraph_paragraphbuttonui-ParagraphButtonUI.html) and [`HeadingButtonsUI`](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_heading_headingbuttonsui-HeadingButtonsUI.html) which make it possible to replace the `headings` dropdown with separate buttons for each heading level.

PS. The `1.0.0-beta.3` version number was skipped in order to align the project version number which diverged from builds version numbers
